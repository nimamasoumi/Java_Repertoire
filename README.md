## Usage and run the program ##

- Step 1:
  Compile the source codes into bytecode class files using Java Compiler (javac). For instance:
  
  `javac Concepts/Classing/*.java`
  
  
- Step 2:
  Run the code by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For instance:
  
  `java Concepts/Classing/AbsClassTest`
  

## Remarks ##

I am expanding my Java programming knowledge everyday. I create codes to showcase the concept in a comprehensible example. Following is the list of topics that I generated the exmaple codes:

1. Primitive types in Java
2. Abstract class, interfaces, and class inheritance
3. Thread class, Multithreading, Runnable, interrupting, and join a thread.
4. Synchronization of threads using the synchronized modifier for a method and a statement.
5. Concurrency of threads by managing the intrinsic/monitor lock, and using wait() then notifyAll() methods.
6. Building a graphical user interface application
7. Primitive arrays, List, ArrayList, and generic types
8. Implementation of mathematical formulas using the java.lang.Math package
9. Calculation of &pi; using BigDecimal with 1000 decimal points precision
