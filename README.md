# Usage and run the program #

- Step 1:
  Compile the source codes into bytecode class files using Java Compiler (javac). For instance:
  
  `javac Test/Classing/*.java`
  
  
- Step 2:
  Run the code by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For instance:
  
  `java Test/Classing/AbsClassTest`
  

# Remarks #

I am expanding my Java programming knowledge everyday. I create codes to showcase the concept in a comprehensible example. Following is the list of topics that I generated the exmaple codes:

1. Generic types in Java
2. Abstract class, interfaces, and class inheritance
3. Thread class, Multithreading, Runnable, and interrupting a thread.
